    <h2>A little about me</h2>
    <div class="half-width">
        <p>
            I’ve made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island with my small growing family.
            My journey into tech started with a degree in journalism. As I started sharing my writing online,
            I was fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there.
            I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="half-width">
        <p>
            That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut.
            When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me
            the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work.
            Now I’ve made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my
            organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.

                    <h3>Hand Coded HTML</h3>
                    <p>
                        My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that
                        the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.

                    <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
                    <p>
                        I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on.
                        I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay
                        up to date on current best practices.

                    <h3>Ease Converting Designs into Code</h3>
                    <p>
                        You can trust me to take a designer’s PSD and
                        quickly & accurately convert it into a webpage that is pixel-perfect match.
